### Hi, I'm Alex

I'm a self-taught Front-End Developer and Mobile Engineer with an MSc in Product Design.

Nowadays I'm mostly tinkering with iOS and Android apps using **React Native** and **TypeScript**.

I'm a **React Native Developer** at [**Tempo**](https://www.yourtempo.co) where I'm working on bringing Tempo to mobile.

In my free time, I'm building a simple and free weather app called [**Tiny Weather**](https://tinyweather.app). You can learn more about it at [tinyweather.app](https://tinyweather.app) or download it on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/tiny-weather-simple-forecasts/id1522059185) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexandersandberg.tinyweather).

Also, I sometimes publish things at [**alexandersandberg.com**](https://alexandersandberg.com) and tweet stuff at [@alexandberg](https://twitter.com/alexandberg).
