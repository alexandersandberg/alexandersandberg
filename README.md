### Hi, I'm Alex.

I’m a self-taught **Mobile Engineer** with an MSc in Product Design.

Nowadays I’m mostly tinkering with iOS and Android apps using **React Native** and **TypeScript**, and lately some **Swift** and **SwiftUI** as well.

After sadly having to [sunset Tempo](https://alexandersandberg.com/sunsetting-tempo), I’m now taking a break from full-time roles to spend some time on my own things.

One of those is [**Tiny Weather**](https://tinyweather.app), a simple and free weather app that I’m building. You can learn more about it at [tinyweather.app](https://tinyweather.app) or download it on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/tiny-weather-simple-forecasts/id1522059185) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexandersandberg.tinyweather).

I’m also doing some **freelance work** whenever I come across interesting projects needing my help.

Occasionally, I also publish things at [**alexandersandberg.com**](https://alexandersandberg.com) and tweet stuff at [**@alexandberg**](https://twitter.com/alexandberg).

Other than that, I like taking each day as it comes.
