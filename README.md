### Hi, I’m Alex.

I’m a self-taught, **product-minded iOS/macOS Developer** with a background in web development and product design.

Due to my curiosity for both design and development, I love working on meaningful products in close collaboration with designers and product people, and being part of the "why".

By day I work as an iOS Developer at [Practice](https://practice.do) where I, together with an amazing team, build a tool that helps individuals run their entire practices and coaching businesses from one place. (Sounds interesting? We’re [looking for more great people!](https://practice.do/careers))

By night I like to build [apps](https://alexandersandberg.com/apps/) that solve problems or satisfy needs that other apps haven't yet. I built [Tiny Weather](https://alexandersandberg.com/apps/tiny-weather/) because I couldn't find a beautiful, simple, privacy-minded weather app. I built [Tiny Softbox](https://alexandersandberg.com/apps/tiny-softbox/) to fix my bad office lighting. I'm building [Balance](https://alexandersandberg.com/apps/balance/) to help people achieve and maintain work-life balance.

I'm a member of the [Swift Website Workgroup](https://www.swift.org/website-workgroup/) (SWWG)—a steering team that helps guide the evolution of the [Swift.org](https://www.swift.org) website.

Other than that, I like taking each day as it comes.
