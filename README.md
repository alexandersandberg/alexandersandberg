### Hi, I’m Alex.

I’m a self-taught, **product-minded Mobile Engineer** with an MSc in Product Design.

Due to my curiosity for both design and development, I love building high-quality mobile apps in close collaboration with designers and product people.

I work as an **iOS Developer** at [Practice](https://practice.do) where I, together with an amazing team, build a tool that helps individuals run their entire coaching businesses in one place. (Sounds interesting? We’re [looking for more great people!](https://practice.do/careers))

In my free time, I build a simple and privacy-focused weather app called [**Tiny Weather**](https://tinyweather.app). Occasionally, I also publish things at [alexandersandberg.com](https://alexandersandberg.com) and tweet stuff at [@alexandberg](https://twitter.com/alexandberg).

Other than that, I like taking each day as it comes.
